Chest and Shoulders

I love doing chest and shoulders the same day for one simple reason: all of the chest exercises use shoulders. By starting your chest routine with some shoulder exercises, you can make sure you are fully warmed up and at full power. I love going heavy on chest, so if my shoulders are not properly warmed up, sometimes they will start hurting and I wont be able to lift at full power. So follow these exercises to maximize chest and shoulder gains!

NOTE: if you have any questions, never hesitate to ask!


Exercise 1
Lateral raises
3 to 4 sets (depending on how warmed up you feel)
8-12 reps
Make sure you go light, but not light enough that it feels like you are flapping your arms. Be careful with how you control the weight and make sure not to get injured. 

Exercise 2
Bench press or dumbell press

This is one of the core exercises, meaning that is is extremely important. The only way to get bigger and stronger is lifting heavy weights, but we have to be careful not to get injured which is the worst thing that can happen. If you are working out alone or are not confident enough doing bench press alone, dumbel press is better. And generally dumbel press is better because it isolates each chest muscle much better than bench press where you can cheat a little bit. I usually do chest press cause its more fun and you can go heavier, but dumbel press is objectively better. Its up to you.

What we want is to warm up with light weight, and increase the weight each set. The first times you probablly wont know your full strenght, so take it easy and find out how strong you are.

Set 1
Lightweight that you can comfortably press for around 12 reps without much struggle
Set 2
Middleweight that after 8-10 reps it feels slightly heavy
Set 3
Heavyweight, find the heaviest weight you can press without risking yourself, aim for around 4-6 reps, with the 4th one being a struggle to move
Set 4
back to middle weight, do as many as you can

Exercise 3

Incline Bench

This exercise is crucial to work upper chest, but the catch is that it heavily relies on shoulders as well. It is similar to shoulder press except that you are leaning back at a 30-45 degree angle. We are gonna follow the same set structure as Exercise 2. I recommend you start with dumbells before moving to the bar. 
Set 1
Lightweight that you can comfortably press for around 12 reps without much struggle
Set 2
Middleweight that after 8-10 reps it feels slightly heavy
Set 3
Heavyweight, find the heaviest weight you can press without risking yourself, aim for around 4-6 reps, with the 4th one and on being a struggle to move
Set 4
back to middle weight, do as many as you can

Exercise 4
Shoulder press.

Although similar to incline bench, this one entirely isolates the shoulders. By this exercise your shoulders might be fatigued, so be mindful of the weight you choose. 
Set 1
Lightweight that you can comfortably press for around 12 reps without much struggle
Set 2
Middleweight that after 8-10 reps it feels slightly heavy
Set 3
Heavyweight, find the heaviest weight you can press without risking yourself, aim for around 4-6 reps, with the 4th one being a struggle to move
Set 4
back to middle weight, do as many as you can

Exercise 5
Burnout superset

This set will demolish you. We are gonna start with chest flies, hopefully a fly machine if you have one. Otherwise you can do it with dumbells but the technique is not easy and you might get injured if you do them wrong. Dont hesitate to ask me if you havee any questions. After each set of flies, we are gonna do shoulder front raises with dumbells. For front raises dont go super heavy, find a weight you can rep not too easily, but it should not be heavy enough that it causes pain or discomfort

Set 1
Lightweight that you can comfortably rep for around 12 reps without much struggle. Make sure you squeeze your chest when bringing your arms together. 
After the flies immediately do the front raises. This repeats through each set
Set 2
Middleweight that after 8-10 reps it feels slightly heavy
front raises
Set 3
Heavyweight, find the heaviest weight you can rep without risking yourself, aim for around 4-6 reps, with the 4th one being a struggle to move
front raises
Set 4
back to middle weight, do as many as you can
front raises

If you want to check how well you worked out, try to do as many pushups as you can. If you can do more than 10-20, then you could've gone a bit harder. 
After the workout, do 100 crunches and 50-100 calf raises. 

Its important to do abs and calves every day, since these muscles regenerate quickly and are crucial to train. We have to be balenced and hit everything!
